# About this guide

## Why yet another git resource?

There are many git resources out there. But most, if not all, of them assume that the user is familiar with the command line.

Even when writing this, I was tempted over and over again to sneak in a line of git commands or two. This is because it would allow me to skip cooking up examples and analogies. But I decided against it. I want this guide to be accessible to everyone.

Now, I'm not saying that you can't use the command line. I'm just saying that you don't have to.

I want to prevent the following scenario:

A few GUI git clients I recommend _(I expect Linux users to know their way around the command line)_ -

1. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) -  
    For general use. Targeted at beginners. Best image diff viewer. Start here.
2. [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) -  
    For advanced users. Has a lot of features. Better visualization. Move to this when you've outgrown GitHub Desktop.

I use a combination of both.

When even GitKraken's features are not enough, know that it's time to type commands.
